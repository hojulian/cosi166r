<%= homework_hdr %>

1. **RTHW:** Complete [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/preface.html) up to exercise 45. Your success in the whole course will be strongly affected by how comfortable you get with Ruby. Itâ€™s a really fun and interesting language. 
1. <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> **Products**: Come up with a few product ideas. Just think about what you always wanted in the world. Maybe you already have an idea in mind? Anyway, for inspiration you may look at <%= link_to_topic :product_inspirations %> or anywhere else. It doesn't matter where. Select between one and three that you might want to work on in this class. Remember the caveat: Don't set the bar at "this is the most wonderful product idea I ever saw". Set it at "this is a product that could be interesting to develop and work on." Write up (in 1 or two paragraphs) your favorite product idea(s)! <%= deliverable("Submit your report as a pdf to Latte.") %>
1. **PA_MOVIES_1**: Continue working on PA_MOVIES_1. It is due next class! This assignment will get you to write some basic code with Ruby. You will learn how to read files work with data in arrays and hashes. If you are stuck, ask one of our wonderful TAs for assistance.

##### Interesting (optional) Reading
* Geting to Ruby from another langauge (e.g. Java, Python, PHP, and others.): [Ruby from other languages](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/ruby-from-other-languages/)
