1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Paper Prototype**: Read this paper about [Paper Prototyping](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/paperprototyping/). Design a paper prototype for your team's product.  Remember, this is an inidividual assignment, so that we can compare each team member's vision of what the product might be. We will assess your work based on the care and thought you put into it, not on whether the UI itself is awesome. <%= deliverable "Readable image of your paper prototype. If you just take a cell phone picture of a drawing in pencil (worst case) it will not be legible." %>
1. <%= zipbadge %> **PA Rails 1:** Complete work on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_1 %>. Submit your code as a zip file. <%= deliverable "Rails app as a zip file." %> Begin work on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_2 %>.
1. <%= partbadge %> <%= teambadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **Weekly Team Update:** Submit your <%= link_to_topic :weekly_progress_updates %> according to the instructions. <%= team_deliverable "Weekly Progress Update" %>
1. <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> **ActiveRecord Tricks Reflection:** Study this video. You will learn a lot about ActiveRecord! [ActiveRecord Tricks](https://www.driftingruby.com/episodes/activerecord-tricks). Take notes while you are watching it (its very short.) I strongly recommend you download the code from his website and follow along. Below are my very rough notes on changes you need to make so it will work. Include in your notes three things that you learned that were super cool! <%= deliverable "Your notes about problems you hit getting the tricks to work and three supercool ideas you got and how you will use them." %>
1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **RORT:** Read [Ruby on Rails Tutorial Chapter 5](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning#cha-beginning) - "Filling in the layout. Here we see how to create views, and start seeing a lot of HTML and getting into routing at a greater level of detail. As usual I really encourage and ask you to go through the code samples and actually type them in. You will see that it really helps your understanding and will assure your success in this course! Use your resources: the TAs, the class mailing list, stack overflow, google and push through to success! When you are done, go to Latte and answer these warmup questions:
    * Give me your explanation on what `link_to` is and does. As specific as you can.
    * When and why would you use a partial?
    * What does he mean (in conclusion) by a custom routing rule?
    * Are there one or two things you are still confused by? If not, what one or two things were the most memorable about your reading? <%= deliverable "Submit your asnwers as a pdf to latte.." %>
