## 1.Read [The F35s terrible bug list](http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2016/02/f-35s-terrifying-bug-list/125638/?oref=DefenseOneTCO)

It's an interesting view into the real world impact that bugs have. Also that Fighter jets are really computers with wings on them! Also read [There's more to Ruby Debugging than puts](https://engineering.shopify.com/17489080-theres-more-to-ruby-debugging-than-puts?utm_medium=email&utm_source=rubyweekly). Lots of very practical tips and ideas about debugging, as well as some really useful Ruby tricks.

## 2. Learn all about Test Driven Development. <%= zipbadge %> 

Please look over **all** the linked resources: [RailsGirls Guide to Test Driven Development](http://guides.railsgirls.com/test-driven-development), [Rails Guide for Testing](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html), Read [Minitest Quick Reference](http://mattsears.com/articles/2011/12/10/minitest-quick-reference), [MiniTest::Spec tutorial](http://www.rubyinside.com/a-minitestspec-tutorial-elegant-spec-style-testing-that-comes-with-ruby-5354.html). Do the following assignment: <%= link_to_topic :hw_tdd %>

## 3. Get your app deployed onto [CodeShip](http://www.codeship.com). <%= pdfbadge %>

Log in with the email of the GitHub account who owns the official team repository. The documentation of CodeShip is quite good. Ensure that whenever the team pushes to your master branch, the tests are automatically run and if they pass, the result is pushed out to Heroku.

<%= team_deliverable "Submit as a pdf the text of the log generated by CodeShip to demonstrate that it is working." %>
