### Product Brainstorm 30 minutes
* Groups of 3-5 students in class - 15 minutes
  * Get to know each other a little
  * Each student, in turn describes the product that they proposed
  * Discuss your favorite product that you proposed or some other student proposed
  * Prepare to explain it to the class in about 1 minute, so not a lot of detail
  * Each group presents one product

### Next Class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
