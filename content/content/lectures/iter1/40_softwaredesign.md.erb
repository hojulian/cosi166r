## Logistics

* Checkin questions
* Discuss progress on Ruby
* Discuss <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %> and <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_2 %>
* Any burning questions

## Class Norms

* Be a professional. Treat other team workers as you would want to be treated and show respect for one another.
* Be patient with each other, your TAs, and Pito. We are all human, and these are difficult times. You never know what is going on in someone's life outside of this class.
* Be an active participant in class and in your group. Keep your cameras on and remain engaged in discussions. This pushes everyone to be better, and makes the class a better experience for all involved.
* Be cooperative and spread the resources. Share interesting readings/challenges you face as you build your app and what you learned from them.
* Disagreements happen, but be open to constructive criticism. Always consider that people are coming from a positive place and do not have malicious intention.
* It's okay to feel nervous! That means you're pushing yourself to move outside of your boundaries.
* Believe in each other and have confidence in yourself!
