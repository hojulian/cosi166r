### Rails Points of interest

* So what is Rails, really? It's a library of Ruby code, that's all
* Decode them ("routing")
* Generate the necessary HTML ("views")
* Return the html as a response to the request ("Controller")
* Why do they call Rails 'opinionated' software?
* Go through the directory structure?
* Key files and directories
  * Routes.rb
  * Models / Resources
  * Views
  * Controllers

### Breakout (30 minutes)

* Everyone on their own, look through *all* the [product ideas](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=1571070) and post a comment or two
* Which one are you impressed with? How happy are you with the ones your team came up with? What new ideas come to mind
* If you want to modify what you've posted (no deleting) or add something new, that's fine!
* Each team prepare to give a 1 to 2 minute presentation on what idea you are going for!

## That's all for today!
