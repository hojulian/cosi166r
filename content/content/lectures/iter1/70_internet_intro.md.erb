### Rails Points of interest

* So what is Rails, really? It's a library of Ruby code, that's all
* Simply to accept HTTP requests
* Decode them ("routing")
* Generate the necessary HTML ("views")
* Return the html as a response to the request ("Controller")
* Why do they call Rails 'opinionated' software?
* Go through the directory structure?
* Key files and directories
  * Routes.rb
  * Models / Resources
  * Views
  * Controllers
