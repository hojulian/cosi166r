## Logistics (20 minutes)

* Checkin questions
* One of the principles of Agile development is to have running code as soon as possible and all the time
* Let's take a look at <%= link_to_topic :mini_scrum %>

### Term Project (10 minutes)

* Instead of a final, this course will have a Showcase day where everyone presents and demos their products
* You will need to plan out what you want to have working on that day
  * Think of this as the absolute minimum demo of your product that you want to have working by the product showcase.
  * What is the essential coolness of your product? Can you demo that?
  * Remember a perfect login or user settings page is not essential coolness.
  * Think of the aha reaction you want in the viewer.
  * Remember you can always exceed that!
* Narrow your focus!
  * You will make a detailed mockup/paper prototype of your 1 or at most 2 core views your 1.0 will require
  * Detailed not because it has beautiful colors but because it covers the layout AND interactions that will work.
  * Everything from here on should be support that core view and nothing more!
  * Divide and conquer! Make sure each team member has a distinct deliverable!
  * Dig into the difficult things - don't avoid them in favor of the easy things!
* Review of the stages and deliverables: <%= link_to_section :intro, :term_project %>

### Breakout (30 minutes)

* Everyone on their own, look through *all* the [product ideas](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=1571070) and post a comment or two
* Which one are you impressed with? How happy are you with the ones your team came up with? What new ideas come to mind
* If you want to modify what you've posted (no deleting) or add something new, that's fine!
* Each team prepare to give a 1 to 2 minute presentation on what idea you are going for!
