#### Ongoing Work

* **Project Teams:** You should be up to around **STORY**
* **Rails PA 1** Working on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_1 %>. You can see the assigment and due dates here: <%= link_to_topic  :pa_rails_guide %>

#### My addenda on getting the tricks work:

* YMMV
* download github with code from activerecord tricks
* modify gemfile to remove ruby version line
* delete .ruby-version file from the directory
* to see hidden files `ls -la`
* rails db:seed to generate seed files
* rails console to get to the prompt for rails commands
* Status.all to see all the records in the Status table
* app/comment.rb - delete default scope
* add gem 'hirb' to gemfile; bundle
* in rails console, Hirb.enable
