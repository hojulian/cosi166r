#### Ongoing work
* **Rails PA 2** Working on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_2 %>. You can see the assigment and due dates here: <%= link_to_topic  :pa_rails_guide %>
* **Project teams:** Although there are no specific deliverables, you should be following <%= link_to_section :intro, :term_project %>. Not just during lab and during your meetings, but on your own. Remember with a team of four (or 3 or 5) students, that's a lot of horsepower, and so we have high expectations. The sooner you kick into gear the better!

### Summary and wish

* I want you to always refer back to principles such as these when you design or present a user experience.
* It's very easy to say, "Oh it's common sense." But you submit designs that violate these principles left and right.
* It's important. Make it part of your toolkit. Internalize it! Take care!

### Scary Discussion about project progress

* Where should you be right now
* How to interpret the project roadmap
* What does success look like?

<%= discussion_box("I know you're all in the trenches getting *anything* to work. What did you think of the various articles and papers? Some simple lessons you learned about UI. What article was the best? How will they be applicable to your products?") %>

### Look at next class
* Look at homework <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
