##### Ongoing Work

* **Project teams:** Although there are no specific deliverables, you should be following <%= link_to_section :intro, :project_roadmap %>. Not just during lab and during your meetings, but on your own. Remember with a team of four (or 3 or 5) students, that's a lot of horsepower, and so we have high expectations. The sooner you kick into gear the better!
* **Rails PA 1** Working on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_1 %>. You can see the assigment and due dates here: <%= link_to_topic  :pa_rails_guide %>


#### Discussion
* Explain TA Clients and their role
* Each team give a 1 minute summary of the product
* Discuss some exemplar Schemas that were designed
* How hard is it to follow the syntax required?

#### Relational Databases and Object Oriented Software
* What does an ORM do?
* "Impendance misatch"
* The "ActiveRecord" Object Oriented Pattern
	* Wraps records *you are working on* inside an object of the Active Record pattern
	* **Not** every record in the database, just what the code is working on at one time or another
* The Rails Activerecord layer
* What is the relationship between the underlying DB and the AR objects
* What is database Migration. What problem does it solve?
