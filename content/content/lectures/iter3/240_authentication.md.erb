#### Ongoing Work
* **Project teams:** Although there are no specific deliverables, you should be following <%= link_to_section :intro, :term_project %>. Not just during lab and during your meetings, but on your own. Remember with a team of four (or 3 or 5) students, that's a lot of horsepower, and so we have high expectations. The sooner you kick into gear the better!
* **Rails PA 2** Working on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_2 %>. You can see the assigment and due dates here: <%= link_to_topic  :pa_rails_guide %>

### Authentication and Authorization
* <%= link_to_topic :auth2_concepts %>

* <%= link_to_topic :auth2_rails %>

### Look at next class
* Look at homework <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
