##### Ongoing Work
* **Teams**: Continue working on your projects!

#### Today
* 30 Minutes "ASK ME ANYTHING" with Glenn McDonald.
* Look at <%= link_to_topic :poro_service_objects %>

##### Discussion on the homework

* What Did you really do? What is the key to it?
* How did it feel to program in this way? Was it easier, harder, different?
* Conventions: file names, separating the tests from the code (why?)
* What do "I" do with testing in "real life"?
* Whats the difference between Rspec and Minitest?

##### Donald Knuth quote
* Interesting from an old archival letter between Knuth and Emde Boas.
* Knuth very famous, Emde Boas, not so much.
* If you look at the attached paper you also see what I think is one of the very earliest uses of classes. It is on Figure 2: Page 1 of classroom note.

#### Testing and TDD Intro
<%= include_topic :testing_intro %>

##### Some examples
* Let's take a look at: [Dumb Factorial Implementation](https://github.com/pitosalas/tdd_demo/blob/master/tdd_demo.rb)
* What other tests can we do to test this Factorial class?
* There are a huge variety of tools and techniques to avoid repetitious coding
* We will be using the built-in unit testing framework called "minitest"
* For this course focus ONLY on unit testing

##### Testing a full ruby class
* Let's take a look at <%= link_to_topic :money_class_test_example %> or [PlayingCard Class](https://github.com/pitosalas/tdd_demo/blob/master/playingcard.rb)
* Break into groups and come up with a list of tests that you would write

#### Look at next class
* Look at homework <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
