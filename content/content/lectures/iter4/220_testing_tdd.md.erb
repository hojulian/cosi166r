##### Ongoing Work
* **Teams**: Continue working on your projects!

##### Interesting, optional reading

* You may know that I am a space travel geek, especially about the early exploration in the 60's and 70's. If you are too, you will find this quite interesting: [Software Glitch in the Apollo Lunar Mission (3 minutes)](https://spectrum.ieee.org/video/aerospace/space-flight/don-eyles-space-hacker)
* Test doubles, mocks, and similar concepts are a powerful abstraction for independently testing complex subsystems. Of course we're using minitest, but rspec is a popular alternative test framework. Bottom line they are both quite similar to each other. [Test Doubles in Theory, in Minitest and Rspec](http://ieftimov.com/test-doubles-theory-minitest-rspec).
* Good advanced testing concepts: [Test Doubles â€“ Fakes, Mocks and Stubs](http://pragmatists.pl/blog/2017/03/test-doubles-fakes-mocks-or-stubs/?__s=sp8sgb9wzgpq5zssprse)
* Video talk by the original inventor of Rails where he argues strongly (the only way he knows how to argue) against TDD. This video: [RailsConf 2014 Keynote](http://youtu.be/9LfmrkyP81M), from last year caused untold controversy.


#### Today
* 30 Minutes "ASK ME ANYTHING" with Glenn McDonald.
* Look at <%= link_to_topic :poro_service_objects %>

##### Discussion on the homework

* What Did you really do? What is the key to it?
* How did it feel to program in this way? Was it easier, harder, different?
* Conventions: file names, separating the tests from the code (why?)
* What do "I" do with testing in "real life"?
* Whats the difference between Rspec and Minitest?

##### Donald Knuth quote
* Interesting from an old archival letter between Knuth and Emde Boas.
* Knuth very famous, Emde Boas, not so much.
* If you look at the attached paper you also see what I think is one of the very earliest uses of classes. It is on Figure 2: Page 1 of classroom note.

#### Testing and TDD Intro
<%= include_topic :testing_intro %>

##### Some examples
* Let's take a look at: [Dumb Factorial Implementation](https://github.com/pitosalas/tdd_demo/blob/master/tdd_demo.rb)
* What other tests can we do to test this Factorial class?
* There are a huge variety of tools and techniques to avoid repetitious coding
* We will be using the built-in unit testing framework called "minitest"
* For this course focus ONLY on unit testing

##### Testing a full ruby class
* Let's take a look at <%= link_to_topic :money_class_test_example %> or [PlayingCard Class](https://github.com/pitosalas/tdd_demo/blob/master/playingcard.rb)
* Break into groups and come up with a list of tests that you would write

#### Look at next class
* Look at homework <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
